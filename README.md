## Quiz Game Coding Challenge
### Overview
Your challenge is to create a 10 question, true or false, quiz app in React. **You should not just implement the most basic solution. This is a chance to show off your abilities and impress.**

**The application code will be reviewed and scored on these key areas with many subset areas for each:**

- Functionality
- Code Format
- Project Structure
- Scalability
- Maintainability
- Use of industry best practices  

### Goals
Implement the screens based off the wireframes and api below using **advanced techniques** and **industry best practices** for your platform. Note that the wireframes may not be complete, so use your best judgment for UI/UX implementation. **Do not use a boilerplate like React Boilerplate or Ignite for this challenge.** We want to see how you structure your project and what tooling you use from scratch. **Create-react-app is fine to use.**
